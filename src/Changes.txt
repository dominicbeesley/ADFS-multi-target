Rationalised source file naming structure
-----------------------------------------
!MkIDEm.bat      - batch file to build Master ADFS with IDE drivers
!MkMMCm.bat      - batch file to build Master ADFS with user port MMC drivers
!MkSCSIm.bat     - batch file to build Master ADFS with SCSI drivers

masIDE.asm       - launch file to assemble Master ADFS with IDE drivers
masMMC.asm       - launch file to assemble Master ADFS with user port MMC drivers
masSCSI.asm      - launch file to assemble Master ADFS with SCSI drivers

bbcIDE.asm       - launch file to assemble BBC ADFS with IDE drivers
bbcMMC.asm       - launch file to assemble BBC ADFS with user port MMC drivers
bbcSCSI.asm      - launch file to assemble BBC ADFS with SCSI drivers

elkIDE.asm       - launch file to assemble Electron ADFS with IDE drivers
elkMMC.asm       - launch file to assemble Electron ADFS with user port MMC drivers
elkSCSI.asm      - launch file to assemble Electron ADFS with SCSI drivers
The above would be easier if BeebAsm had a '-Dlabel' option

adfs.asm         - Core ADFS source
MMC_Driver.asm   - ADFS disk command -> MMC command
MMC.asm          - high level MMC card driver
MMC_UserPort.asm - low level user port->MMC access

Changes.txt      - this file

adfs.asm, 21-Feb-2016
---------------------
Added LARGE_DISK option, for future use for using full 24-bit sector address.
Added TRIM_REDUNDANT to remove redundant code where possible.
Optimised *INFO code when TRIM_REDUNDANT=TRUE.
Removes Break+-> option when TRIM_REDUNDANT=TRUE.

MMC.asm, 20-Feb-2016
--------------------
Corrected error numbers. Shouldn't be errors, should be return results.

adfs.asm, 26-Mar-2016
---------------------
Added platform-specific define block to generate Electron, BBC, Master ADFS.
Version number/string generated from code capability.
Rationalised IF/ENDIF blocks.

MMC_Driver.asm, 27-Mar-2016
---------------------------
Code transfer loop checks for failure result from MMC calls.

MMC.asm, 27-Mar-2016
--------------------
All routines return ADFS result to caller, don't bomb out with errors.
Optimised MMC_BEGIN, MMC_INIT, Command/RandomAddress, incAddress.
Moved some code to remove from JMPs.

MMC_UserPort.asm, 27-Mar-2016
-----------------------------
MMC_WriteEnd returns ADFS write error codes.

adfs.asm, 27-Mar-2016
---------------------
Chopped out redundant floppy sector range test, redundant *DELETE entry
if building for Master. Moved some MMC calls to more appropriate places.
Optimised some inline code into subroutines, used 65C12 code where possible.

adfs.asm, 28-Mar-2016
---------------------
Rewritten disk error generation, crunched OSARGS, BGET/BPUT update, CheckOpen.
Probably the biggest optimisations done. Down to about 180 bytes too long.
Will start going through Zorn's high-crunch optimisations.

adfs.asm, 08-Apr-2016
---------------------
Tail optimised converting disk_addr to side/track/sector.

adfs.asm, 09-Apr-2016
---------------------
Tail optimised LoadFSM, RootSector. Merged *CAT/*EX, looped some code, crunched
BGET return, SetDriveCommand, CheckAddr, SectToCtrl. ADFS-Master-MMC now crunched
down to exactly 16384 bytes. Need a few more bytes to be able to check for MMC
presence on Reset to prevent hanging when absent.
